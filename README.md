# NIB-Project

Introduction:
	NIB is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization incorporated in the state of New York, with headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia. NIB was created following the passage of the Wagner-O’Day Act in 1938, which mandated the federal government purchase products made by nonprofit agencies (NPAs) serving people who are blind. NIB is the largest employer for people who are blind.  Since 1938, National Industries for the Blind (NIB) has focused on enhancing the opportunities for economic and personal independence of people who are blind, primarily through creating, sustaining and improving employment. NIB and its network of associated nonprofit agencies are the nation's largest employer of people who are blind through the sale of SKILCRAFT® and other products and services provided by the AbilityOne® Program, established by the Javits‐Wagner‐O'Day Act (41 USC 46-48c). Despite continued gains in employment, people who are blind remain one of the nation’s greatest untapped labor resources. In fact, 70 percent of working‐age Americans who are blind are not employed. This statistic fuels NIB’s mission to create, sustain and improve employment opportunities for people who are blind.
